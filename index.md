This is my first personal blog ever! I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Memphis, Department od Chemistry. Joined [Dr. Wang's](https://yongmeiwang.github.io/) group in the Spring of 2019. My research focus is in Physical Chemistry, but I found my passion about a year ago in Bioinformatics. I've been learning ever since step by step and absolutely enjoyed the path so far. I'm looking forward to persue my career in this field.
